In October when a member of the City Council, David Moore of the 17th Ward, proposed that Lake Shore Drive be renamed for Jean Baptiste Point du Sable, Heather Miller, a member of the Wyandotte Nation of Oklahoma and the executive director of the **[American Indian Center](https://www.aicchicago.org/)** of Chicago, rolled her eyes.

“I thought, here we go again,” she said, sitting in her office at the center in the Albany Park neighborhood. She has no real gripe with Moore or Du Sable but would like to see the history of this area’s indigenous people, here for centuries before Du Sable, become part of any conversations about history and racial equity.

Moore got his idea on a boat ride on the Chicago River, telling a Chicago Crusader reporter, “They mentioned every architect and individual that had something to do with this city, but Jean Baptiste Point du Sable’s name wasn’t mentioned at all. That infuriated me.”

That’s thin-skinned, even for an alderman. I don’t doubt Moore’s sincerity, but aren’t there enough inequities and troubles in this city to infuriate (and occupy the time and energies of) aldermen and the rest of us?

To remind you, Du Sable is generally regarded as this area’s first non-native settler. Believed to have been of Haitian and French descent and handsome and well educated, he was here by the 1780s, establishing a trading post/home on the northern banks of the Chicago River near what is now the glistening Apple outlet. He married a woman named Kitihawa (Christianized to Catherine), who was likely a member of the Potawatomi tribe. They were married at Cahokia, the ancient Native American settlement east of St. Louis.

Though there remains much speculation and confusion about the details of Du Sable’s life, his connection to what would be Chicago (incorporated as a town in 1833 and as a city in 1837) ended in 1800 when he moved south to the town of St. Charles in what is now Missouri. There he and Kitihawa raised a son named Jean and a daughter named Susanne. It is believed that he died on Aug. 28, 1818, and was buried in an unmarked grave.

It is likely that the Du Sable marriage was more than a union of convenience. The couple was together for more than three decades.

It took more than a century for Du Sable’s name (and what some felt was his overlooked significance) to become part of the city’s historical narrative. But since then he has been honored in many ways. The bridge that spans the river at Michigan Avenue is named for Du Sable and there is a statue and plaque at its northern end. His name is affixed to the boat harbor a bit further south and a small park just to the east. In Washington Park is the fine and interesting DuSable Museum of African American History (**[dusablemuseum.org](http://www.dusablemuseum.org/)**).

I have no problem with any of that. But was Du Sable the city’s “founder”?

“Calling him the city’s founder ignores the hundreds of years that Indian tribes used this place as a major trading spot, a center for all manner of commerce and travel,” says Les Begay, the chairman of the AIC’s board and a member of the Diné Nation.

He and Miller are bullish on the AIC, which is the country’s second-oldest urban-based Native America community center. It is a modest place with big ambitions, meant to serve the 65,000 Native Americans who live in the greater Chicago area, the second-largest population east of the Mississippi River. They talked of the AIC’s public programs, educational efforts and proudly showed off a wonderful current exhibition of the art of Leonard Peltier. They talked of being part of the **[recent “Serpent Mound Celebration”](https://www.chicagotribune.com/lifestyles/ct-life-santiago-x-mounds-indigenous-peoples-day-20191014-20191014-4brj2mikendx7ewjwglcg6ot3i-story.html)** held in Schiller Woods.

We talked of the differences between American Indian, Native American and Indigenous People and agreed that any were acceptable, “though some of the usage changes depending on what generation is talking." The pair mentioned some of the “unfortunate ways” that Native Americans are represented in very public ways, such as The Bowman and The Spearman statues at the entrance to Grant Park which portray naked warriors on horseback.

They are pleasantly upbeat rather than pessimistic and as talk moved back to Du Sable, we wondered what it might mean to have Lake Shore Drive renamed for Du Sable’s wife Kitihawa.

“There’s an interesting idea,” said Miller, who told of some “very thoughtful and encouraging conversations” she has been having in the wake of the LSD-Du Sable proposal with Candace Moore, the city’s first chief equity officer.

As hard as it is to imagine any alderman taking up the Kitihawa cause, it is equally hard to think that the LSD name change proposal will get any traction.

This is not the first time an alderman has floated this idea. In 1993, then 4th Ward alderman (now Cook County Board President) Toni Preckwinkle made the same proposal. Some of her colleagues supported her, as did such citizens as **[Lerone Bennett Jr.](https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/obituaries/ct-met-lerone-bennett-obituary-20180216-story.html)**, then executive editor of Ebony magazine who argued that Du Sable was “the first person to see the commercial possibilities of the place, the first person to say, ‘I Will’.”

(“I Will,” of course, is one of the mottoes of the city, along with such others as “Urbs in Horto” Latin for “City in a Garden” and more playfully Mike Royko’s “Ubi Est Mea,” Latin for “Where’s mine?” )

There was much debate at a meeting of the City Council’s Committee on Transportation and Public Way. More than 30 witnesses testified, equally split between those for and those against. As the Tribune’s Bob Davis reported, “applause and groans repeatedly sounded” as the proposal was defeated 8-2.

Moore’s proposal, supported by a few of his colleagues, can be read on the **[Office of the City Clerk website](https://chicago.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=4154638&GUID=E84BCFE5-5D6E-41A8-AF0C-A72E215C9C84&Options=Advanced&Search=&FullText=1)**. It now sits with the transportation committee and says in part, that it is “appalling that the founder of this great city has no major street named after him …”

What is more appalling, most would agree, is the ways in which Native Americans suffered a long history of genocide, dispossession and racism.

Is it enough that a few streets and avenues and neighborhoods — Menomonee, Ottawa, Mohawk, Winnebago, Blackhawk, Pontiac, Winnemac, Milwaukee Avenue, Washtenaw, Sauganash Park — echo Native American words and names?

“When school groups come here they are so curious,” says Miller. “They want to know the real history of this place and get excited when they hear it.”

So, what to do about Lake Shore Drive?

Actually, it’s fine as it is. The lake’s been here, well, forever and who knows where we’d be without it?
