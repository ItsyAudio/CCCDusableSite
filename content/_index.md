# Exhibition Overview
## By Avanté Love  

Much like the structure of a web where connections are plenty and ever evolving, we as Chicago’s residents endlessly work together to birth new pathways for the making of a greater world. We speak to each other from one end to the other, not always aware of our influence on the land and its influence on us. Making resources out of our differences, we trace our roots to the visions and primary settler of Jean Baptiste Point Du Sable, who himself would give thanks to the culturally rich world around him. 
Explore this space with the intention of seeing what is and what could be. See the hands of those who shaped this land, when Chicago was first and foremost Checagou, and learn from them. For the part of ourselves that yearn to meet where our feet have not gone is where Du Sable lies, in our dreams. So, like our ancestors, all carried by the waters, here we’ll immigrate, commemorate, join hands and oscillate through time and this intricate space that we all call home.
